This project holds the components and datastructures specific to the XCRI-CAP aggregator project.

Specifically, the repository contains the FeedManager and Discover applications. Both are groovy/grails applications
which require access to a configured mongo service.

Invidvidual handlers may need specific additional components such as apache solr, elasticsearch, 4Store / BigData.

Clearing down...

In development it's sometimes useful to be able to clear down the datastores. The scripts directory contains a reset script that can be used
to clear down the content of all repositories.

Building...

Prereqs: Grails.

We have added a copy of an install script in the scripts directory which checks out a clean copy of all dependencies and copies them to a local
apache tomcat. Modify this or use it as a basis for your own build script.

Requires a local 4store installed (deb apt-get install 4store, mkdir /var/lib/4store, 4s-backend-setup default)
