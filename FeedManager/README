Experimenting with

as a means of supplying shibboleth authentication.

When running in dev env, the three component apps are run in their own grails envs as

grails -Dserver.port=8090 run-app  (HandlerRegistry)
grails -Dserver.port=8080 run-app  (Repository)
grails -Dserver.port=8081 run-app  (FeedManager)

SMTP settings need to be added to the FeedManager-config.groovy file stored locally
The SMTP settings are configured according to mail server type, see grails mail plugin page for more details: http://grails.org/plugin/mail
